### Day 2  ***Fixed schedule or spontaneous schedule*** 

Q:Regarding your daily routine, do you prefer to have a fixed daily schedule or do you like to be more spontaneous? How does your preference affect your day - to - day life?

A:I prefer a more **spontaneous schedule**.
For example, when I need to focus on something to achieve my goal, my spontaneous schedule made it difficult for me to focus on achieving it

Let me give you an example. Right now, I'm speaking to you, but actually, I had a deadline to finish my task of practicing my oral English. However, you know, it's already 12 o'clock at night right now.

I think I should write down the important things in my atomic notes. It can help me focus on the things that are important to me.

Day 3 ***AI and job opportunity & My home town Dehua***

Artificial Intelligence is developing faster and fast  now and it has already replace some positions **held by human beings.**

**The example I want to bring up is in the education industry**. You know, the education industry seems to be facing the impact of being replaced by AI. In fact, many people are now turning to AI for **knowledge acquisition** instead of **physical human teachers.** This is because AI can be more intelligent in some aspects. For instance, I'm learning oral English from you, John Foster, an AI teacher, instead of a **person physically present in the real world.**

I think we've covered this topic sufficiently for today.


Dehua, located in Fujian province, is a place rich in charm and character. It has a long - standing reputation for its **exquisite porcelain production**. The town's **kilns** have been crafting beautiful porcelain pieces for centuries, with each item **showcasing** the remarkable skills of **local artisans**.

***Dehua has a rich variety of local cuisine.*** There are special dishes made from black - colored animals like black - feathered chicken, black rabbit, and black duck. These **unique ingredients** result in d**elicious and distinct flavors**. Moreover, t**he soups in Dehua are quite famous.** For example, there's 'Ku Cai Tang' and 'Guo Ji Cao Tang'. These soups are not only delicious but also very **nutritious**.

### Day 4 ***Digital game*** 

It really depends, in my opinion. The impact of video games varies from person to person. From my perspective, if a young person knows which video games are beneficial to them and enjoys playing those particular types of games, then I believe they will experience more positive influences rather than negative ones.

However, if a person lacks self - control when it comes to video games, it can have negative impacts on their physical well - being.

Q：So, could you give me an example of a type of video game that you think is beneficial? And perhaps an example of how lack of control over video games can affect one's physical life? For instance, some might say excessive gaming can lead to poor physical health due to long periods of sitting. What are your thoughts on these aspects?

A：
Indeed, prolonged sitting due to excessive video - game playing can lead to numerous health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases. This is a crucial issue that we, especially young people, should pay close attention to. In today's digital age, many individuals struggle with the problem of extended periods of sitting, and video - game usage is often a contributing factor.

  

However, it's inaccurate to assume that video games are entirely bad for physical well - being. In fact, some games can be beneficial to those who are interested in them. For example, there's the game “Death Stranding”. In Chinese, it's “死亡搁浅”. This game features a narrative centered around delivery missions. Then, there's another game related to the concept of Turing completeness. I assume you might be referring to a game that explores the fundamental principles of computing, dealing with binary digits like zero and one.

**A**: In the beginning, I ran 3 - 5 kilometers every day. It was a bit tough at first, but over time, it got easier.

**A**: Running has a significant impact on my life. After my daily running routine, I feel more energetic. It helps me get a healthy body and stay away from diseases.
